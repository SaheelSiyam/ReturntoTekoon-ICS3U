I am the Sphinx of Arkren!
Only those of uncommon intellect have managed to pass me!
To pass me, you must play a simple game of wit.
I am thinking of a five letter word
You must guess individual letters in the word
You must input English letters, regardless of case
If you input anything but, you will lose attempts.
Examples include: numbers, special characters, foreign letters
And I will be most displeased at your arrogance
This is a matter of life and death, after all..your life..
You have ten attempts. Ten different letters.
Fail, and I will eat you.
I have not eaten in a century, so I quite hope your wits fail you
Don't worry, Jellib, it will be instantaneous and painless
Are you ready, my young challenger?
If not, I can simply eat you right now..
